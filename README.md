# RbxSync

RbxSync is an open source ROBLOX plugin that easily integrates any third-party code editor or IDE, such as Sublime Text, Notepad++, VS Code, or Atom, into ROBLOX Studio. This repository aims to port the [original RbxSync][Evaera RbxSync] to the UWP platform, making it's delivery to the Windows ROBLOX community easier.
